File Structure Breakdown

.\Block 1\Files:
    * a.out, out.txt, and out.vcd are the output files generated by iverilog and vvp.
    * block1.v is the final version of the Block 1 code, with block1.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * sevenseg.v is the final version of the Seven Segment code, with sevenseg.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * tb_block1.v is the successful testbench file that generates the output files above.

.\Block 1\System:
    * The main file in this folder is the block1.qpf file. This is the file that tells the Quartus software which files
      to compile and the pin assignments for the MAX 10 FPGA, connecting all the I/O ports to their correct physical
      components.
    * The block1.qsf file is also extremely important - this is where the actual pin assignments and connections are stored
      and referred to.

.\Block 2\Files:
    * See Block 1\Files notes - the only difference here is the fadder.v, a separate file that is instantiated inside the
      block2.v program in order to create the full adder structure. It also has a .bak file as a backup.
    * This folder also includes gtkwave.jpg, a screen capture of the GTKWave output created by the testbench and vvp.

.\Block 2\System:
    * See Block 1\System notes.

.\Block 3\Files:
    * See Block 2\Files notes.

.\Block 3\System:
    * See Block 1\System notes.
