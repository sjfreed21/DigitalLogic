File Structure Breakdown

.\Files:
    * a.out, out.txt, and out.vcd are the output files generated by iverilog and vvp.
    * bcd1.v is the final version of the ones place counter, with bcd1.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * bcd2.v is the final version of the tens place counter, with bcd2.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * clkdiv.v is the final version of the clock divider, with clkdiv.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
      THIS FILE MUST BE MODIFIED IN ORDER TO RUN tb_lab2.v - SEE COMMENT ON clkdiv.v, line 9.
    * lab2.v is the final version of the top-level Verilog file, with lab2.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * sevenseg.v is the final version of the Seven Segment code, with sevenseg.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * tb_lab2.v is the successful testbench file that generates the output files above.
      Run using "iverilog .\lab2.v .\tb_lab2.v .\clkdiv.v .\toggle.v .\bcd1.v .\bcd2.v .\translate.v .\sevenseg.v".
    * translate.v is the final version of the value to month/day translator, with translate.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.

.\System:
    * The main file in this folder is the lab2.qpf file. This is the file that tells the Quartus software which files
      to compile and the pin assignments for the MAX 10 FPGA, connecting all the I/O ports to their correct physical
      components.
    * The lab2.qsf file is also extremely important - this is where the actual pin assignments and connections are stored
      and referred to.

Also in this file are screen captures of the GTKWave output generated by tb_lab2.v.
    * GTK_Normal.jpg shows the GTKWave output when the program is running without any modifiers - 1 Hz clock and not a leap year.
    * GTK_Leap.jpg shows the GTKWave output when the program is running with SW[9] set to 1 - the year is a leap year. 
      Note the marker location - it can be seen that right before the marker, the month value is 2 and the day is 29 - leap day!
    * GTK_Fast.jpg shows the GTKWave output when the program is running with clktoggle high - in reality, this is the switch
      that would create the 5 Hz clock. Note the time scale on the top axis - significantly faster than the previous two images.
