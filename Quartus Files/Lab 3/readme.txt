File Structure Breakdown

.\Files:
    * a.out, out.txt, and out.vcd are the output files generated by iverilog and vvp.
      Note: these files were generated before the creation of the ROM, with mach.v serving as the top-level file.
    * clkdiv.v is the final version of the clock divider, with clkdiv.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * counter.v is the final version of the 2-bit counter, with counter.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * csl.v is the final version of the current-state logic, with csl.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * ctlmem_bb.v, ctlmem.qip, and ctlmem.v are the ROM initiating files generated by Quartus.
    * ctlmem.mif is the file that initiates the memory in the ROM created by the files above.
    * lab3.v is the final version of the top-level Verilog file, with lab3.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * mach.v is the final version of the state-machine file, with mach.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * nsl.v is the final version of the next-state logic file, with nsl.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * ol.v is the final version of the output logic file, with ol.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * sevenseg.v is the final version of the Seven Segment code, with sevenseg.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * slowclk.v is the final version of the slow clock divider, with slowclk.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.
    * tb_lab3.v is the successful testbench file that generates the output files above.
      Run using "iverilog .\mach.v .\tb_lab3.v .\clkdiv.v .\counter.v .\csl.v .\mach.v .\nsl.v .\ol.v .\sevenseg.v
      .\slowclk.v .\toggle.v", as well as by uncommenting lines 30 and 36 and commenting out lines 31 and 37 in mach.v.
      Note: this file was designed before the creation of the ROM, with mach.v serving as the top-level file. This should
      not affect the running of iverilog, but has not been tested to maintain the integrity of a.out, out.txt, and out.vcd.
    * toggle.v is the final version of the toggle code, with toggle.v.bak a backup file generated by Quartus.

.\System:
    * The main file in this folder is the lab3.qpf file. This is the file that tells the Quartus software which files
      to compile and the pin assignments for the MAX 10 FPGA, connecting all the I/O ports to their correct physical
      components.
    * The lab3.qsf file is also extremely important - this is where the actual pin assignments and connections are stored
      and referred to.
